Class Tutorial

Hello Professor and Fellow Classmates. My name is Trevor Kelly, I am twenty-one years old, and I currently live in Bradenton, Florida. The
last Spring semester I received my Associates of Science Degree in Computer Networking. I am still a full-time student working towards my
Technology Development and Management Bachelor of Applied Science Degree with the Cybersecurity sub-plan. I anticipate Graduating Spring
of 2019. I am taking this course as one of my graduation requirements for my Bachelorâ€™s Degree. When I find free time, I like to go to
Disney with my family, I like to go camping, and I like to go sporting clays.
